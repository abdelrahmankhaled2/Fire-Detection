# Fire-Detection
# Fire Detection System

## Overview
This repository contains code for a fire detection system using image processing and deep learning techniques. The project aims to classify images into two categories: fire and non-fire. The code is organized into several sections, including data preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

### Data Loading and Exploration
- Load and explore a dataset containing fire and non-fire images.

### Image Preprocessing
- Implement image preprocessing techniques, including masking, segmentation, and sharpening.

### Feature Extraction
- Extract features from images using histogram-based and GLCM-based methods.

### Deep Learning Models
- Build and train deep learning models using Keras for both histogram and GLCM features.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using classification reports and visualize training metrics.

### Sample Images
- Display sample images and their corresponding processed versions for better understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
